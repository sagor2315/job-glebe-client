## The 5 key features of my site.

My site is Job-related where a user can behave if he wants in two ways like a job adder and a job applier. Here I will try to explain briefly about 5 features of my site.

**Site Name: https://b8a11-client-side-mdzahidulisl.web.app/**

- **1. Login and LogOut:** My site has an authentication and authorization system. If a user wants to interact with the private feature of this site then he/she will need to authenticate first in other words needs to sign up first. After signing up he/she needs to log in to enter the private section.
-
- **2. Add A Job:** If a user wants to post a job as an employer then it's possible to do so because on my site this feature is available. He or she will be able to post a job in detail like a Job banner, company logo, total applicant number, job category, salary, job responsibility, etc everything and of course, it's a privately protected route for doing this type of work needs to signup first then login.
-
- **3. Appliy A Job:** In the apply job section, if a user or a candidate has authorization like signup and login then he can apply for a job by giving his real information. After Appling he will get notified by email.
-
- **4. My Job Section:** If someone posts or adds a job then this job will be set in the My Job section as a tabular format. Here only he will see his posting job, not other users. He can not apply for his job.
-
- **5. All Jobs Section: ** Here All Jobs will be set also as a tabular format. It is not that type of section that only sets a single-user job but also for all the users who are posted or added a job will be set in this section and it's not a privately protected route, anyone can see this section without authorization.
